			<p>A work in the wisdom literature genre that deserves to be more widely
known is Spanish philosopher Balthasar Gracián&rsquo;s 1647 <em>Oráculo Manual</em>,
AKA <em>The Art of Worldly Wisdom</em>. It consists of 300 numbered paragraphs,
each starting with a very short proverbial saying and then explaining
some insight about human nature and how to get on in the world.  As the
title suggests, it is definitely on the pragmatic side, with
surprisingly few expressions of traditional piety, especially
considering that Gracián was a Jesuit. It has some of the literary DNA
of Machiavelli, though not nearly as ruthless and more focused on the
individual.</p>
<p>My journey with this work began when I stumbled across a charmingly
bound pocket-size English edition in my local used
bookstore, slipcover and all. Check it out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wise are always grouchy&hellip;&rdquo; I knew it!</p>
<p>This is a mid-20th century translation by one Martin Fischer, who was a
medical doctor and professor at the University of Cincinnati.  I read
the whole thing through a little at a time over a period of months. In
the end, however, I found this translation to be overly literal; it
seems to be trying too hard to imitate Gracian&rsquo;s extremely terse
style. Fischer admits this and tries to justify his approach in the
introduction, but to my taste he still goes too far, to the point of
having some real head-scratchers of sentences. When I compared it to
other translations, I could even see that in some places Fischer
outright missed the meaning of the Spanish idiom. I was pleasantly
surprised to find that I actually liked the 1892 translation by Joseph
Jacobs better, though I&rsquo;m not qualified to evaluate it critically.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the reason this post is here: I found this work
sufficiently edifying that I wanted to come back to it. There are public
domain texts of the <em>Oraculo</em> and translations available online, but I
specifically wanted it in a format that I could print and underline and
take notes in. I also thought the original text could provide a good
opportunity for me to improve my Spanish (or at least to not lose the
little knowledge I have.)  So I took the original Spanish text and
Jacobs&rsquo; translation, and pasted them into tables in a LibreOffice Writer
document to make my own &ldquo;parallel edition&rdquo;, suitable for printing on
8-1/2 by 11-inch paper or reading online as a PDF. I am not a skilled
desktop publisher or anything, but anyway, here it is for anyone else
who might be interested.</p>
